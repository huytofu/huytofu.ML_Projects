Fancy living in a space that ""transforms"" whenever and however you need to use it?

This studio apartment may appear small, but it does have some nifty ideas on keeping clutter out of sight and maximising space, thanks to this designer.

The aparment has a minimalist concept, with concrete screed flooring, grey walls, white laminate and wood tones for a touch of warmth.

The space may look small, but it really has everything the homeowner needs hidden out of sight!

The ""rooms"" of the apartment, such as the kitchen, are concealed behind full-height pivot doors, for a clean look. There is even a folding table!

Every inch of space is utilised — hooks and cubby shelves are installed on the inside of the doors of the hideaway kitchen.

Another ""secret"" space is the wardrobe and dressing area. Everything is within easy reach, with open compartments for make-up, a full-length mirror and a power point for the hairdryer.

See the clever use of space for the bomb shelter! It is outfitted with sliding shelves that store and display the homeowner's collection of shoes, so that bulkier items can be stowed away behind.

Above the bed is an origami-inspired feature, which disguises an awkward corner and adds interest to the otherwise plain area.

The Interlace, one of the largest and most ambitious residential developments in Singapore, presents a radically new approach to contemporary living in a tropical environment. 

Designed by Ole Scheeren, partner of OMA, The Interlace adopts a new residential typology which breaks away from the standard isolated, vertical apartment towers of Singapore. The large-scale complex takes a more expansive and interconnected approach to living through communal spaces which are integrated into its lush surrounding greenbelt.

The area is set to get more accessible, with a new MRT station, Punggol Coast, set to open by 2023. The station was originally slated to be ready by 2030, but plans were brought forward to support developments in Punggol North such as new estates at Northshore District, Punggol Point District as well as the Punggol Digital District. The new station will come with the construction of a 1.6-km extension on the North-East Line (NEL), which aims to cut travelling time to the city by 15 minutes.

Thomson Impressions is a well-designed development. The main attraction for Thomson Impressions however is its location. It is in a very tranquil part of Thomson, surrounded by landed property. Thomson Impressions is also on elevated land meaning it is even more protected from what noise there is.

Marymount MRT is the closest station which is around a 7-minute drive away. When the Thomson East Coast Line is up and running in 2020, Bright Hill Station will be around a 10-minute walk from Thomson Impressions.

There are a few malls a relatively short drive or bus journey away, and one of the island’s most famous primary schools which is Ai Tong Primary School. It is a 10-minute walk from the development.

Location:
Interesting developments that will change the landscape of D15 forever.Within a 2km radius in D15 Tanjong Katong, starting from Meyer to Amber, big developers Substained Land, Bukit Sembawang, UOL, City Dev and Guocoland have simultaneously bought land via enbloc in the span of the past 2 years.

What did these big developers see in this area that the public have yet to see?

With the upcoming Thomson East Coast line, D15 will only be 4 MRT stops away from Marina Bay, where some units at projects like Marina One Residences are transacting over $3,000 psf, and projects in that area are only 99 years leasehold. This area is also just minutes away from the future Paya Lebar Commercial Hub.

The residential ones are made up of 1, 2 and 3 bed units, plus one 3 bed penthouse and two 4 bed penthouses. The 1 and 2 bedders are among the largest anywhere in Singapore.

The nearest MRT stations to SeaHill are Clementi and Haw Par Villa, but in reality neither are in realistic walking distance. There is talk about extending the Jurong Region MRT line via a West Coast Extension in just this area however, so if that does go ahead, it would very much benefit future residents of SeaHill. There are bus routes that serve the area, with bus175 and 176 stopping outside the side entrance into SeaHill.

Why The Siena?

Sited in the prime Bukit Timah precinct, The Siena, with a limited collection of 54 SOHO apartments, features high ceilings, a unique layout and distinctive space planning concepts.

SOHO concept enables homeowners maximise their unique space in The Siena, allowing homeowners to segregate or integrate live-work-play spaces interchangeably according to their lifestyle needs. 
For example, entrepreneurs can have the flexibility of separating their designated work space from the private home space in the day through the use of sliding doors, thereby minimizing disruptions or distractions. At night, the work area can transform into a space for entertaining guests or the family living area with just a few simple adjustments.

Located close to the Botanic Gardens MRT Station, and is surrounded by choice international and local educational institutions such as the Nanyang Primary School. 

Residents can also enjoy the range of lifestyle and retail options from Holland Village, Dempsey Hill, and Orchard Road, in addition to nearby malls and eateries; all located just a few minutes’ drive away. Nature lovers will also appreciate that The Siena is within walking distance to the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
