Kingsford Waterbay overlooks the Sungei Serangoon. The 9 towers that make up the development are arranged so that every unit either overlooks the river, or the facilities located at the project. The sheer number of facilities sets Kingsford Waterbay apart from most of its competitors, and it boasts 2, 50 metre lap pools, a wave pool and tennis court amongst many others, arranged in 6 distinct zones. Though it is not in easy walking distance to an MRT, Kingsford Waterbay is a short drive to several malls, Hougang MRT and, due to its close proximity to the KPE, it is only a 20 minute drive into the CBD.

Kingsford Waterbay ‚Äì Accessibility

There is not an MRT within easy walking distance of Kingsford Waterbay. The nearest one is Hougang a 5 minute drive or 10 minute bus drive away. From there it is just over 20 minutes to get to the CBD. There are 2 bus routes that take you to the station, as well as a shuttle service that takes residents of Kingsford Waterbay straight to Hougang Central. Heartland, Fernvale and NEX malls are all within a short drive or bus ride from the development, offering a good range of retail and F&B choices. For drivers, the KPE is very close at hand, which connects to the TPE for Tampines, Pasir Ris and Changi. In the other direction, it takes you to the CBD via the MCE or CTE, both which will take about 20 minutes.
