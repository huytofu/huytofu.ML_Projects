The Scotts Tower is situated in one of the most desirable locations in Singapore, right in the middle of District 9. Its 231 residential units are made up mostly of 128 large SOHO style 1 bedroom flats, which are not just spacious, but very well designed, fitted and built. Residents of The Scotts Tower will also benefit from a wide range of facilities. The location is ideal, with Newton MRT just a 5 minute walk away, meaning commuting to the CBD is quick and easy. The development is within walking distance of the shopping malls of Orchard Road (or 1 stop on the MRT) and is surrounded by a very large choice of dining options from Newton Food Court to very high end restaurants.Far East Organization is the largest property developer in Singapore and have developed over 500 properties in Singapore, especially in the Orchard Road area. It is the only developer in the world to have won eight FIABCI Prix d’Excellence Awards, which is considered the highest honour in international real estate.

The Scotts Tower – Unique Selling Points

The location of The Scotts Tower will be a big draw, with its proximity to some very nice restaurants, the Orchard Road shopping belt and the ease of getting into the CBD or Marina Bay by both car and MRT. The development itself is also worthy of note, with its very spacious SOHO style 1 bed units really offering a luxury lifestyle choice.

The Scotts Tower – Accessibility

Newton MRT Station is the nearest to The Scotts Tower, being a 5 minute walk away. It is on the Downtown and North South Lines. Orchard is just one stop away from there with the botanic gardens and Raffles Place two and five stops away respectively. Orchard MRT Station itself is also walkable, being approximately 10 minutes away by foot.

The Seawind

The Seawind is a residential development located in the peaceful, mature neighbourhood of Telok Kurau, in District 15. The immediate vicinity is characterised by quiet leafy streets, but it is only a short distance to many retail and dining options.The development itself is a very good looking project, with stunning townhouses, as well as Soho and condo style units, offering a good choice for both families and young couples. The Seawind is a freehold property.


The Seawind – Unique Selling Points

The Seawind’s location is excellent. The neighbourhood is mainly populated with private bungalows and more recently high class condos. Despite its peaceful and laid back vibe, it is also very close to the many amenities that makes this area so popular – a combination that is difficult to beat or even match. The forthcoming MRT will only add to the connectivity of the area, but The Seawind is screened enough from that to not be adversely effected. There are a number for very good schools in walking distance. Another big plus point for The Seawind is the fact it is a freehold development.",D15,All races welcome,,,Fully Furnished,,Flexible,The Seawind,1 Bath,1 Bed,,S$4.16 psf,"S$2,600/mo",https://www.99.co/singapore/rent/property/the-seawind-condo-hrmKyF3qZoq22GCgCo25mn

The award winning residential development that is The Interlace is a unique addition to the Singapore condominium scene. It split over 31, 6 storey blocks are clustered around 8 individually themed courtyards, specifically designed to maximise both air flow and light. Located in Depot Road in Alexandra, The Interlace is within short walking distance of the Gillman Barracks, with its eclectic mix of dining options, while commuters can be in Raffles Place in a quarter of an hour. Orchard Road is a short drive away or a few stops on the MRT from Labrador MRT, 10 minutes’ walk from the development.

The Interlace has two major selling points. First of all the award winning development itself is unique in its design and scale, and offers residents a vast array of different options in terms of relaxation, and leisure within the site itself. The 8 differently themed courtyards and the facilities within the blocks mean it is very much a destination in its own right. Additionally however, The Interface benefits from its location on Depot Road. The Gillman Barracks with their eclectic mix of galleries and eateries is a short walk away, as are the several parks making up the Southern Ridges. Commuters can be in Raffles Place in a quarter of an hour, and Orchard Road is a short drive away or a few stops on the MRT from Labrador MRT, 10 minutes’ walk from the development.",D04,All races welcome,,,Fully Furnished,,Flexible,The Interlace,4 Baths,4 Beds,,S$3.75 psf,"S$15,000/mo",https://www.99.co/singapore/rent/property/the-interlace-condo-uUgSN2J4QBL8T35tmFxmwZ

WHY RENT THIS STUDIO
-----------------------------------
EVERYONE LOVE PRIVACY AND THE FREEDOM TO COME BACK LATE AT NIGHT. THERE IS NO OWNER STAYING IN THIS APARTMENT SO YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A CINDERELLA AND BE BACK BY 12-MIDNIGHT. TENANT ALSO ENJOY FREE INTERNET WIFI WHICH COULD SAVE YOU UP TO $50 EVERY MONTHS FOR YOUR INTERNET SUBSCRIPTION FEE. THE PRICE RANGE OF THIS STUDIO BETWEEN $1300 - $1500 IS ALSO VERY HARD TO FIND AS MOST OF THE STUDIO IN SINGAPORE RANGE BETWEEN $1600 - $2500. MOST OF THE CHEAPER STUDIO USUALLY LOCATED AT THE FAR CORNER OF THE ISLAND     LIKE JURONG, WOODLAND OR CHOA CHU KANG ETC, BUT OUR STUDIO IS 10-15 MINS DRIVE TO CBD. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I COULD THINK OF IS THERE IS NO KITCHEN, HOWEVER, WE WILL PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS IF ITS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO DO SOME LIGHT COOKING. 

THIS STUDIO IS WHAT YOU DESERVE.

WHY RENT THIS STUDIO
-----------------------------------
EVERYONE LOVE PRIVACY AND THE FREEDOM TO COME BACK LATE AT NIGHT. THERE IS NO OWNER STAYING IN THIS APARTMENT SO YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A CINDERELLA AND BE BACK BY 12-MIDNIGHT. TENANT ALSO ENJOY FREE INTERNET WIFI WHICH COULD SAVE YOU UP TO $50 EVERY MONTHS FOR YOUR INTERNET SUBSCRIPTION FEE. THE PRICE RANGE OF THIS STUDIO BETWEEN $1300 - $1500 IS ALSO VERY HARD TO FIND AS MOST OF THE STUDIO IN SINGAPORE RANGE BETWEEN $1600 - $2500. MOST OF THE CHEAPER STUDIO USUALLY LOCATED AT THE FAR CORNER OF THE ISLAND     LIKE JURONG, WOODLAND OR CHOA CHU KANG ETC, BUT OUR STUDIO IS 10-15 MINS DRIVE TO CBD. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I COULD THINK OF IS THERE IS NO KITCHEN, HOWEVER, WE WILL PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS IF ITS NECESSARY FOR YOU TO DO SOME LIGHT COOKING.
