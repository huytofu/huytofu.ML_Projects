Thomson Impressions – Accessibility

Due to its location in a mainly landed property area, Thomson Impressions does not have a great deal of amenities on its doorstep. Marymount MRT is the closest station which is around a 7-minute drive away. When the Thomson East Coast Line is up and running in 2020, Bright Hill Station will be around a 10-minute walk from Thomson Impressions. There are a few malls a relatively short drive or bus journey away, and one of the island’s most famous primary schools which is Ai Tong Primary School. It is a 10-minute walk from the development.

From its position, City Gate dominates Beach Road and the surrounding area – one that has been earmarked for dramatic changes in the forthcoming years. From its 25 storeys, residents will be able to not just see all the way down Beach Road but across the conservation area of Kampong Glam, one of the go to places on the island for quirky boutiques, fabric shopping, middle eastern dining and partying. Being a mixed development, City Gate benefits not just from the abundance of retail and F&B options in its immediate neighbourhood, but also from those in its own backyard. Nicoll Highway MRT Station is only a 5 minute walk away.Bayfront Ventures Pte. Ltd is comprised of Fragrance Group and World Class Land (WCL) is a commercial and residential development company in Singapore.

City Gate – Unique Selling Points

The area around Beach Road is being targeted for grand developments, while leaving the nearby conservation areas such as Kampong Glam unscathed. This means future residents of City Gate will be able to enjoy the best of both worlds. The convenience of living in a mixed development is obvious, and City Gate will boast numerous retail units as well as 29 restaurants, a food court and large supermarket. Outside though there is the shopping, dining and partying extravaganza that is Kampong Glam, as well as the bars and restaurants along Beach Road. Nicoll Highway MRT Station on the Circle Line is only 5 minutes’ walk away, giving access to the CBD and Orchard, while numerous bus routes are just outside City Gate itself.",D07,,,,Partially Furnished,,Flexible,City Gate,2 Baths,2 Beds,,S$7.50 psf,"S$4,200/mo",https://www.99.co/singapore/rent/property/city-gate-condo-3V4BjC2FbHvx5EmhdCaXed

Located in the unique Bugis area, one that has been cited for major development, but development that will add to much of its charm not destroy it, DUO is very much at the forefront of that. As well as a 5 star hotel, office space and retail podium, DUO has 660 luxurious residential units based in a distinctive 49 storey tower that overlooks Kampong Glam. Surrounded by a myriad of dining and shopping options for all tastes and budgets, DUO is also connected to Bugis MRT Station via an underground walkway meaning trips to the CBD, Marina Bay and Orchard could not be easier.Owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Malaysia’s strategic investment fund, and Singapore’s investment company called Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd, M+S Pte Ltd was established in June 2011 to develop Marina One Residences and DUO.

DUO is very well designed and built with elegant and stylish touches throughout. It also gives a nod to its surrounding area, giving it a unique look and feel. The neighbourhood and surrounding area is crammed with dining, retail and partying options, and has a truly eclectic look and feel that is unique to Singapore. DUO is opposite Kampong Glam, a conserved area, with its winding streets full of quirky boutiques and interesting bars and restaurants.

One of the attractions of DUO is its proximity to so many retail, entertainment and dining options, but those needing to get away are catered for as well. DUO is directly linked, via underground walkway, to Bugis MRT Station on the East West and Downtown Lines. City Hall is one stop away, meaning commuting to work in the CBD or weekend shopping trips to Orchard are quick and easy. Changi airport is a 15 minute drive.
